# What's for Dinner? 

### Abstract:
Created to simplify the process of choosing what to have for dinner. This app offers a wide range of recipe options tailored to individuals who have a preference for spooky-themed meals. By generating random meal ideas from a selection of side dishes, main dishes, desserts, or entire meals, our app sparks inspiration and encourages culinary creativity. Developed using HTML, CSS, and JS, the app was designed with simplicity in mind.

### Learning Goals:
* Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript
* Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
* Understand how to listen to and respond to user events
* Individualize your programming skill set

### Wins + Challenges:
Wins:
* Using tools like Code Pen to tweak and experiment with HTML and CSS. I found this especially helpful when I was conceptualizing and brainstorming in the beginning!
* Getting into a netter git workflow! I was unable to fully embrace the new process for my last project, but this time I think I got the hang of it! 
* Connecting HTML, CSS, and JS into one application is pretty amazing! I am proud of the JS I was able to apply but I know it still needs work! 

Challenges:
* Planning and execution. I drew out my layout on paper and then tried to apply it in Code Pen, but once I got into the file I would hyperfocus on small details. I spent more time trying to perfect certain aspects that I lost sight of other functions that needed to be executed. 
* Not giving myself enough time to troubleshoot. I think I overcomplicated my HTML and CSS and therefore didn't give myself enough time to work with my JS. 
* Not getting the clear button and "You Should Make" text hide when they were supposed. I think the solution is in my code but like I said, I did not give myself enough time to troubleshoot this error.
